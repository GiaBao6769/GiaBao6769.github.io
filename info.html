        <p><b>Biography</b></p>
        <p>I'm an English and Information Technology (IT) specialized student. I started off with English, then took on IT in grade 10. I'm not encourageous enough to assert that I'm proficient at anything, but I believe that I'm pretty well-rounded. I can speak 4 languages, Vietnamese - my mother tongue, English - eloquent and influent, French - beginner, and Japanese - able to read and write, not so good at speaking. I can read a little bit of Latin even though I have never learned it, I think it's because I used to do a research on morphemes and word roots in English and I'm quite familar with them. Additionally, I know 6 progamming languagues, including Python - the first languague I learned, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I learned them quite fast, but took a long way up to be competent. Up to day (23/7/2025), I have been studying programming for about 9 months, but all I could do is solving competitive programming problems and making this terrible website.</p>
        <p>As I aforementioned, I like reading, especially fictions and philosophy. My favourite book is <i>The remains of the day</i> of Kazuo Ishiguro. I love it so much that I purchased both Vietnamese and English (original) copies of it. Romance, particularly modern remance, is not my cup of tea. The story behind this is complicated but I would rather read a 1000 pages of philosophy than a "touching" romantic book. That being said, it doesn't mean I hate romance, I just don't like the way it is written in modern books as well as appeared on media. To behold a truly good remance, I suggest reading <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Romio and Juliet</i> (I'm not kidding), <i>The remains of the day</i> (but it contains more thoughts than the acutal love).</p>
        <p>I also enjoying playing games, especially story-rich games, such as <i>Finding Paradise</i>, <i>Impostor Factory</i>, <i>Omori</i>, <i>Rakuen</i>. To some extent, I consider games as a form of art, and can be treated the same as books. Visual is better at conveying story and emotions, mingling with the games' soundtracks, it's even more sentimental. My favorite game developer is Kan Gao. He's also my favorite composer. Kan Gao is well-known for his To the Moon series. He tells stories of his game in a really interesting way. He can turn a story which seems cliché and mundane to a masterpiece with rich and complex details. And the more you unravel the games, the clearer and more transparent they become. When you reach a certain point, you will get a hang of everything, and maybe couldn't hold your tears to the end.</p>
        <p>I don't like modern music. In my perspective, they're like products after the inductrial revolution, being massed produced and deteriorating along with the time, always repeating the same overused formulas and topics (love for example). However, some songs acutally sounds really pleasant, especially ones from indie composers such as Kan Gao, Laura Shigihara, Ngọt, etc. Classical music is my favorite, along with composers such as Johann Pachelbel, Wolf Gang Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederick Chopin, Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebestian Bach, Nicolo Paganini, etc. <i>Pathetique 2nd movement</i> and <i>Moonlight Sonata</i> by Beethoven, <i>Canon in D major</i> by Pachelbel, La Campanella (this piece has an interesting story behind), both versions by Liszt and Paganini are some I listen to often.</p>
        
        <p><b>The meaning behind my avatar</b></p>
        <p>I made this avatar about 2 years ago (2023). Back then, I'm really into transcripting music, so much so that I've spent hours just sitting in front of the screen adjusting notations in Musescore. That was the inspiration for this image, it's a converted treble clef mingling with a bass clef in order to form a shape like letter "B." In the first version, there was no sharp, but then I came up with that idea when I learned about Key signatures to transcript <i>Field of Memories</i> by Waterflame (you can check out that in my Musescore account). A sharp key will turn the whole section to G major, and combine with the <i>B</i> shape, we get <i>GB</i>, which stands for <i>Gia Bao</i>.</p>

        <p><b>My plans in the future</b></p>
        <p>I don't know what I like to do in the future. I won't do things that I like but are unprofitable. People say that if our jobs are things that we like, we can do it without boredom. I don't really believe this. When you do something for a very long time, you will definitely be bored with it, just like love. But doing thing we both like and are good at is better than just repeatively doing one thing. That's why I started endearing myself with programming. I'm not scared of competition, I'm just afraid of poverty. When I'm financially stable, I would like to go study abroad to master a specific field, you know, it's never too late to learn something new. And maybe, I will write fictions and make games. I know they're risky to take them as my main income, that's why I don't do them now. After that, I will fulfill my side hobbies, like music and painting.</p>
        <p>Travelling around the world is also a cool idea. However, it would be not as momorable as visiting each one at different times. I want to have something to reminisce when I get older.</p>
        <p>But what if I live a solitary life forever? I sometimes reflect on this. I'm not the kind of person female would be into. And most of females are not the ones that I'm into as well. Firstly, I'm totally straight. Secondly, I don't like "replica" beauty, that is an appearance that so much people have or urge to have. After all, beauty will fade over time and diginity is the only thing remained. Having said that, I like natural blonde, light skin. Natural colored hair is always sometimes bizarre and exciting to me. And a girl with a Western appearence, that is curvy hair, high nose, or white skin, always stands out to me. Besides, I'm tranditional and conventional, you can say that I'm anachronistic, and that's true. But either you like or dislike that, it's still okay.</p>
        <p>When I was younger, I writed down 10 wishes that I will do in the future, they're genuinely innocent, exept for one, it's bringing a better life for my mother.</p>

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>Quotes I'm impressed by and sometimes comtemplating on.</p>

        <p><i>"I think all our memories, and everything in it... can be nothing but the fiction we tell ourselves" - Neil Watts</i> in <i>Finding Paradise</i></p>
        <p><i>"... There is no point. I'm beyound grateful that our son is out there... But our purpose here is done. What truly happened beyond this world is already set... Why would another virtual ride matter when not even our own did? I've already seen all there is to see... All that truly matters anyway." - Lynri</i> in <i> Impostor Factory</i></p>
        <p><i>"... But what if you haven't? I mean, I certainly had my world shattered too, in more ways than one... But if anything, doesn't this broaden the possibilities, not narrow it? And for that matter, why does it even matter if our reality isn't <i>'base reality'</i>? They may not be <i>the</i> reality, but they were still <b>our</b> realities and all that we'd known. I mean, who's even to say that hers is truly the ultimate end of the stack? What's beyond that gate... It may not be the real relative to her, but it's just as real relative to <i>us</i>. And who knows... Maybe it'll be a glimpse of a reality that is truly out there somewhere. A reality that we can visit, and time to grow old together..." - Quincy</i> in <i>Impostor Factory</i></p>
        <p><i>"... It only felt 'perfect' because it had the context of adversity that already exists here. Without that, where was nothing to overcome... It passed by without even a meaningful ripple." - Neil Watts</i> in <i>Impostor Factory</i></p>
        <p><i>"Have no fear of robbers or murderers. Such dangers are without, and are but petty. We should fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers. The great dangers are within us. That matters it what threatens our heads or our purses? Let us think only of what threatens our souls" - Myriel</i> in <i>Les Misérables</i></p>
        <p><i>"Greater censure attaches to an offence committed under the influence of pleasure than to one under the influence of pain. And in general the one is more like an injured party, forced to anger by the pain of provocation: whereas the other is his own source of the impulse to wrong, driven to what he does by lust." - Theophrastus</i> in <i>Meditations</i></p>
